        <li><b>What is this project about?</b> Reading math texts is difficult. Sooner or later you will get stuck somewhere and you will start writing notes. Maybe on the margin of your book, your lecture script or on a sheet of paper. If you read a lot, these notes have a tendency to get confusing, chaotic and lost. This software helps you organize and store your math notes. It also allows you to share your notes with everybody you like in a secure and precisely controllable manner.
